    <h2>A dating app that focuses on getting you off your island and into a 'ship!</h2>
    <p>Plus we're open source and privacy focused</p>

    <p><a href="./videochat.php">here</a> is a basic video chat interface</p>

    <p>My thinking is:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>user creates account</li>
    <li>user uploads some images</li>
    <li>user answers some questions about:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>why they're on the app</li>
      <li>what they want in a partner</li>
      <li>info about themselves</li>
    </ul>
    <li>the app will cross reference what the user wants with who others are and find the most compatible ones</li>
    <li>app gives 1 person to match with per day* and a 48 hour time limit for texting to have a video call (or they can take it off the app)</li>
    <li>Assume user has a video call, then at the scheduled time they get a notification and they can chat for as long as they like</li>
    <li>after the call, the users can rate their experience with the other</li>
    <ul>
     <li>if a person is consistently getting poor reviews, then that can trigger an investigation or something</li>
   </ul>
    <li>repeat 4 thru 7 until the user removes the app</li>


    <p>*this could be an opportunity for monetization, among other places such as increasing search radius, additional preferences to take into account (for better matches), a longer texting time limit, HD video, addiitonal stats like how many people are available on the app/heatmap of people, etc etc</p>

    <br>

    <h2>User Flow</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>create account</li>
      <li>add images</li>
      <li>provide reason for using the app (MUST give long-term or short-term, nothing in between)</li>
      <li>answer some questions</li>
      <li>get matched with folks</li>
      <li>have a countdown to schedule a video chat</li>
      <li>Video chat</li>
      <li>user reputation rating for text and video (were they inappropriate or spam?)</li>
      <li>periodic reminders to stay viligant about scams and such</li>
    </ul>
  

    <h2>server flow</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>user creates account</li>
      <li>user submits answers about who they are and what they want</li>
      <li>server applies filter to other users and gives compatibility suggestions (filters can include estimated BMI, age, MBTI/OCEAN, life goals, interests)</li>
      <li>user specifies how many they want every few days?</li>
      <li>server facilitates video chat/meetup time & place</li>
      <li>server records user ratings and can offer suggestions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we monetize and what we do with your data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>pro accounts</li>
      <li>free trial period</li>
      <li>ads - not personalized (can come from local shops?)</li>
      <li><b>no user data is to be sold. EVER.</b></li>
      <li>all data should be encrypted, so only users with valid keys can see the data (a la TLS, but we're the verifier)</li>
      <li>must be open source</li>
    </ul>
