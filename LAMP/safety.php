        <h1>Safety on the App</h1>
        <p>It's no secret the internet is a weird and wild place, here's some tips on staying safe an comfortable on the app</p>
        <h2>Stay Vigilant</h2>
        <p>Like they say in the airports, if you see something, say something!</p>
        <p>Rowboat does its best to make sure you are who you say you are, and you're talking to who you think you're talking to, but sometimes people are able to get past our defenses and can pretend to be someone else.</p>
        <p>If someone seems to be pressuring you to do something, especially sending them money or threatening you, <b>report it immediately</b>.</b></p>
        
        <h2>Don't Give Out Personal Information</h2>
        <p>If someone is asking for details about your life you're not ready to share, be cautious! They may be attempting to build a profile about you and use that against you as blackmail or to infiltrate your online accounts.</p>
        
        <h2>Rate Your Interactions</h2>
        <p>As much as dating is an individual endeavor, it's also a social one. By providing feedback about your interactions with others, we can get a better reading who may be a real person, and who may damaging to the community.</p>
        
        <h2>Get Off the App and Into Real Life ASAP</h2>
        <p>Work to set up a time to meet in real life as soon as possible. As much as we like having you here, our goal is to get you on real dates.</p>
        <p>Find a safe, public spot for your date</p>
        
        <h2>It's Okay To Say No</h2>
        <p>We believe that finding the right person is one of the most important decisions you can make, so if someone is making you too uncomfortable, it's okay to say no and maybe come back to them later.</p>
        
        <h2>Vigilance, not Paranoia</h2>
        <p>Most people are good and not out to get you, but a few bad apples can spoil it for everyone. We need to make sure we keep an eye out for those bad apples, but also remember that most of them are still good.</p>
